"""
A Python identifier is the name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.

Rules of a python identifier:
    1. Starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits.
    2. Doesn't allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.
    3. Case sensitive.

Naming Conventions for Python identifiers:
    1. Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
    2. Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
    3. Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
    4. Identifier ending with two trailing underscores is a language-defined special name.
